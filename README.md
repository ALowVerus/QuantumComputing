# QuantumComputing
All code written for Quantum Computing &amp; Information (Dartmouth PHYS 75).


PROGRESS

I've gotten most of the way towards describing the protocol (Section 2). Seems like this is all pretty straightforward. Will put in more time this weekend.

RESOURCES

Original code, which explained the BB84 protocol, sourced from:
https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-key-distribution.html#4.-Qiskit-Example:-With-Interception

Honestly, the HW2 packet had a very comprehensible description of the B92 protocol. If more resources are required, check below:
