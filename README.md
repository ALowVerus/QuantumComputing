# QuantumComputing
All code written for Quantum Computing &amp; Information (Dartmouth PHYS 75).


PROGRESS

I've finished describing the protocol (Section 2). Working the actual quantum code now.

RESOURCES

Original code, which explained the BB84 protocol, sourced from:
https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-key-distribution.html#4.-Qiskit-Example:-With-Interception

Honestly, the HW2 packet had a very comprehensible description of the B92 protocol. If more resources are required, check below:
