# QuantumComputing
All code written for Quantum Computing &amp; Information (Dartmouth PHYS 75).


PROGRESS

Completed Qiskit implementation, uncomment and run final cell to run the protocol many times and check that we see the expected rate of correct measurements by Bob (~25% of key bits transmitted and measured successfully)

I've finished describing the protocol (Section 2), as well as some of the Qiskit implementation (Section 3.1-3.2).

RESOURCES

Original code, which explained the BB84 protocol, sourced from:
https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-key-distribution.html#4.-Qiskit-Example:-With-Interception

Honestly, the HW2 packet had a very comprehensible description of the B92 protocol. If more resources are required, check below:
