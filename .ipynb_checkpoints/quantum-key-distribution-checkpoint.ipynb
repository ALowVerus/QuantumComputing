    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When Alice and Bob want to communicate a secret message (such as Bob’s online banking details) over an insecure channel (such as the internet), its essential to encrypt the message. Since cryptography is a large area and almost all of it is outside the scope of this textbook, we will have to believe that Alice and Bob having a secret key that no-one else knows is useful and allows them to communicate using symmetric-key cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Alice and Bob want to use Eve’s classical communication channel to share their key, it is impossible to tell if Eve has made a copy of this key for herself- they must place complete trust in Eve that she is not listening. If, however, Eve provides a quantum communication channel, Alice and Bob no longer need to trust Eve at all- they will know if she tries to read Bob’s message before it gets to Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some readers, it may be useful to give an idea of how a quantum channel may be physically implemented. An example of a classical channel could be a telephone line; we send electric signals through the line that represent our message (or bits). A proposed example of a quantum communication channel could be some kind of fibre-optic cable, through which we can send individual photons (particles of light). Photons have a property call _polarisation,_ and this polarisation can be one of two states. We can use this to represent a qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Protocol Overview  \n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol makes use of the fact that measuring a qubit can change its state. If Alice sends Bob a qubit, and an eavesdropper (Eve) tries to measure it before Bob does, there is a chance that Eve’s measurement will change the state of the qubit and Bob will not receive the qubit state Alice sent.
